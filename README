Rando World is a dungeon crawler with a special twist. You can log into 
the same world as your friends to fight enemies with them, chat with 
them, or just attack them.

Just type in a name to get started. Use W, A, S, D to navigate and 
chase down your enemies to defeat them.

You are the '@', monsters are red '&'s and other players are green '%'s.
Just type in the chat box to talk with any other players.

The goal? KILL EVERYTHING!!!
